# brythondesktopeditor

Brython Desktop Edtior is a Python code editor that runs in the Google Chrome browser in Kiosk mode.
Use the interpreter Brython (Python in the Browser).

At the moment it allows to edit individual scripts, but it will fail if you try to import modules or load resources,
since it uses a temporary file for the visualization of results.

In future versions you can work with complete projects.
